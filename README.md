# InventoryTracker
React project to create an app that can track restaurant inventory and alert when to order.

Begun as a way to learn React and practice ES6,7+, (and beyond) coding, the app is meant to be useful for tracking restaurant and/or store inventory, and may be able to connect to ordering APIs (such as US Foods, Frontier). Designed to help our local food co-op keep inventory, also to help a specific local bar and grill do the same.
