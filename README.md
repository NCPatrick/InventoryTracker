# InventoryTracker
Intro/Beginner React project to create an app that can track restaurant inventory and alert when to order.

Begun as a way to learn React and practice ES6,7+, (and beyond) coding, the app is meant to be useful for tracking restaurant and/or store inventory, and may in the future be able to connect to ordering APIs (such as those used for US Foods, Frontier, and UNFI, should they allow login access). 

Originally designed to help our local food co-op keep inventory, also to help a specific local bar and grill do the same.
